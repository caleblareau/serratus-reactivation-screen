## Annotating T cell and iPSC BioSamples

To systematically identify BioSamples associated with T cells and/or iPSCs, we queried the relevant NCBI links to generate a set
of accessions for each data class. These relevant links can be found here:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra.

## Queried Terms 

Based on these suggested annotations: 

```
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ncit/terms?iri=http%3A//purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C12476
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ncit/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FNCIT_C124144
```

we used these terms for the queries:

- `“T-Lymphocyte” or "T-cells"` for T cells
- `"iPSCs" or "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells"` for iPSC cells

Note: some of these downloaded accessions / biosamples include non-human entries
