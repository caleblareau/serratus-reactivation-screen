The NEBNext Ultra II directional RNA Library prep Kit (NEB) was used to prepare RNA-Seq libraries according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Paired-end sequencing was performed with 2x 75 cycles on an Illumina NextSeq 500

!Sample_data_processing = The short reads were aligned with STAR (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23104886) version 2.5.0a to the human reference genome GRCh37.p13 with basic two pass method. The counts were then generated using the featureCounts program from the subread toolkit (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24227677) version 1.5.1 .
