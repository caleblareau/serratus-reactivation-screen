!Sample_data_processing = Pair-End 1 reads are processed to get the Cell Barcode and UMI sequences for each read. These infos are attached to Read2 headers.
!Sample_data_processing = Cell Barcodes are corrected, aggragated and the valid cell barcodes are filtered by requiring enough reads (40000 reads for each Cell barcode).
!Sample_data_processing = The Pair-End2(R2) with valid barcodes are splitted to different files accoding to cell barcode prefix. The headers contains information of cell barcodes and UMIs. R1 is not used for alignment.
!Sample_data_processing = The reads are mapped to GRCh38 with STAR aligner
!Sample_data_processing = The aligned bam file is processed to tag the mapped reads to the gene names
!Sample_data_processing = The UMIs counts and read counts for each gene of each cell barcode is calculated and form a expression matrix
