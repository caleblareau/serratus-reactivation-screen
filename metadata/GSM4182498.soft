!Sample_characteristics_ch1 = processing: cytoplasmic fractionation followed by polyA selection with oligo dT
!Sample_characteristics_ch1 = molecule subtype: cytoplasmic mRNA
!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = mRNA-seq: Hep-2 cells were infected with HSV-1 F strain at an MOI of 5 and infection progressed for either 3 or 6 hours post infection.
!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = PRO-seq: Hep-2 cells were infected with HSV-1 F strain at an MOI of 5, and treated at 1 hour post infection with either 10ÂµM Acyclovir, or at the time of infection with 0.01% DMSO, or 0.01% DMSO with 450nM Flavopiridol. Nuclei were isolated at 6 hours post infection.  S2 cells were left untreated before nuclei isolation, and spiked-in to isolated Hep-2 nuclei (1 drosophila nuclei/10,000 Hep-2 nuclei)

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = mRNA seq: Cytoplasmic fractions were collected using the nuclei isolation protocol.  The extracts were subjected to oligodT selection of polyadenylated mRNA using poly-A coated magnetic beads.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = PRO-seq: Nuclei isolation followed by Nuclear Run-on in the presence of biotinylated nucleotides (A, U, G, C).  Biotinylated transcripts were isolated using streptavadin coated magnetic beads
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = mRNA seq: Libraries were constructed by Camille Abshire at Louisiana State University Health Science Center in Shreveport in the Genomics Core using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA LS kit.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = PRO-seq: Libraries were constructed following the protocol outlined by Mahat et al. 2016. "Base-pair-resolution genome-wide mapping of active RNA Polymerases using precision nuclear run-on (PRO-seq).  Nature Protocols. Aug 11(8):1455-76 doi:10.1038/nprot.2016.086
!Sample_data_processing = All processing steps were done using the Danko lab template for PRO-seq alignment/QC found at https://github.com/Danko-Lab/utils/tree/master/proseq with instructions at https://github.com/Danko-Lab/tutorials/blob/master/PRO-seq.md
