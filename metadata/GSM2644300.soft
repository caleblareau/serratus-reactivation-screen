!Sample_data_processing = Illumina Casava1.7 software used for basecalling.
!Sample_data_processing = Concatenated human/HCMV fasta and annotation (.gtf) files were created for mapping and feature counting by combining sequences and annotations from gencode human genome Release 24 (GRCh38.p5) and TB40E-BAC4 (EF999921.1).
!Sample_data_processing = Align sequencing fragments were mapped to the concatenated genome using HISAT2 version 2.0.3 (Kim et al., 2015)
!Sample_data_processing = Strand-specific fragment counts were generated at the gene level using featureCounts (Liao et al., 2014), requiring a minimum mapping quality score of 10 and concordantly mapped fragment ends on the same chromosome.
!Sample_data_processing = In order to eliminate compositional bias, HCMV counts were removed prior to normalization and ratio determination.
!Sample_data_processing = Ratio determination and significance calling was performed using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) with dispersion estimates fit with local regression.
