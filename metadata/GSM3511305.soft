!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = For bulk RNA-sequencing, Cells were resuspended in Trizol and, following Chloroform-mediate phase separation, RNA extracted from the aqueous phase using the CC-25 kit (Zymo). For scRNA-seq, cells were fixed in 80% methanol and analysed using the Drop-Seq protocol (Macosko et al. 2015, PMID: 26000488)

!Sample_data_processing = Bulk RNA-seq reads were mapped to the hg38 reference using Tophat2 (Kim et al. 2013, PMID: 23618408).
!Sample_data_processing = Reads were counted using quasR (Gaidatzis et al. 2015, PMID: 25417205) with the Gencode gene annotation version 28 and stored in the file bulk_RNA-seq_readcounts.txt.gz
!Sample_data_processing = Single-cell RNA-seq data was processed using the PiGx pipeline (Wurmus et al. 2018, PMID: 30277498) to yield the raw counts in HSV1scRNA_rawcounts_allcells.txt.gz
!Sample_data_processing = After filtering cells with less than 2000 detected genes, normalized counts, cell cycle phase and tSNE coordinates were calculated using the Seurat package (Butler et al., 2018, PMID: 29608179) and stored in the files xx. Cell cyle marker genes were taken from Kowalczyk et al. 2015, PMID: 26430063.
