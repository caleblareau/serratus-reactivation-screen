!Sample_data_processing = [UMI index files]  UMI index is part of adaptor ligated to cDNA molecules during library construction, it is used together with mapping location of the reads to identify PCR duplicates.Â UMI indices for cancer samples (C1_index.fastq to C96_index.fastq) were in the base 9 - base 16 (8 bases) of the 16 bases index read, while UMI indices for the normal samples (N1_index.fastq.gz to N32_index.fastq.gz) were in the base 1 - base 8 (8 bases) of the 8 bases index read.
