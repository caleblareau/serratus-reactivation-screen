!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = All cell lines were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). In addition, DG-75-K10/12 were grown with 7.5 μg/mL blasticidin (for gene insert maintenance) and BC-3 media contained 50 μM mercaptoethanol.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = total RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Total RNA was extracted from cells using Tri-reagent (MRC, Inc)
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Libraries were prepared as previously described with some modifications (Pfeffer, S. 2007. Identification of virally encoded microRNAs. Methods Enzymol. 427:51-63). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA from BCBL-1, BC-3 and DG-75-K10/12 were size fractionated on a 17.5% urea denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The 19-33 nt band was excised, crushed and solved in 2 volumes of 0.3 M NaCl by overnight agitation at 4°C.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Small RNAs were sequentially ligated to degenerate 3' and 5' adapters, with T4 RNA Ligase 2 and T4 RNA Ligase 1, respectively, to minimize ligation bias due to secondary structure formation. Prior to this, the 3' adapter was adenylated using the 5' DNA adenlylation kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (New England Biolab, #E2610S).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = After each ligation step, the product was purified in denaturing polyacrylamide gel. In order to generate cDNA libraries, RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen) and primer GCCTGGCACCCGAGAATTCCA, then amplified by PCR with forward primer AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGA and different reverse primers for multiplex sequencing (RPI1, RPI4 and RPI5, Illumina PCR primers) during 14 or 17 cycles (for BC-3, or DG-75-K10/12 and BCBL-1 libraries respectively) (45 sec at 94°C, 85 sec at 50°C and 60 sec at 72°C). PCR products were sent for large-scale sequencing
!Sample_data_processing = Base calling was performed using CASAVA v.1.8.2
!Sample_data_processing = Sequencing reads were preprocessed using the Dustmasker program and FASTX-Toolkit to filter out low complexity sequences and to remove instances of the 3' adapter respectively. Degenerate bases incorporated during the library preparation protocol were also trimmed.
!Sample_data_processing = Remaining reads >=15 nt in length were then mapped simultaneously to the human and KSHV genomes using Bowtie 0.12.7. Up to 2 mismatches in total with no more than 1 mismatch in the first 15 nucleotides of each read were permitted. In addition, only alignments from the lowest mismatch-stratum were recorded and reads that could map to more than 50 loci were discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = To obtain a global overview of each library, several non-coding RNA families were successively annotated using BEDTools 2.16.2, by comparing their genomic coordinates to those of the aligned reads. Expressed human and KSHV miRNAs (miRBase19) were thus identified, followed by human rRNAs, tRNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs and miscRNAs (UCSC repository or Ensembl r.68). During the quantification process, multiple mapped reads were weighted by the number of mapping sites in genomic features of interest.
!Sample_data_processing = Furthermore, two groups of hypothetical viral genomic features, antisense miRNAs (AS-miRs) and miRNA offsets (moRs), were created and submitted to the same annotation process. KSHV antisense miRNAs were defined as opposite sequences to known miRNAs, while moR-5p and moR-3p were defined as being the immediate 20 nt long flanking sequences surrounding the mature forms of each KSHV pre-miRNA.
!Sample_data_processing = Finally, less stringent mapping parameters were applied for the detailed analysis of KSHV miRNA isoforms. Indeed, reads with up to 9mm in total were allowed in order to detect more miRNA altered forms: full length, 3'-trimmed, 3'-tailed, 5'-trimmed, 5'-tailed and every possible combination; whether they are identical or different to the template sequence.
