!Sample_data_processing = Sequencing reads were demultiplexed and adapter-trimmed using flexbar (Dodt et al., 2012) and mapped to the hg19 version of the human genome using tophat2 (Kim et al., 2013) or to the NA construct sequences using bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012).
!Sample_data_processing = Only reads with mapping quality 24 or higher were kept, which also filtered out reads mapping to the constant regions at the beginning and end of the NA constructs. Non-coding genes and Histones were filtered out.
!Sample_data_processing = For ribosome profiling experiments, read lenghtes with high periodicity (21nt, 29nt, 30nt) were also counted separately. Sequencing reads per gene as annotated in the refSeq database were counted using quasR (Gaidatzis et al., 2015).
!Sample_data_processing = Translation efficiencies from readcounts were calculated using RiboDiff (Zhong et al., 2017)
