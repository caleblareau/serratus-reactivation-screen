!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from the blood of healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll (Invitrogen) and a protocol approved by the Hospital for Special Surgery Institutional Review Board. CD14+ human monocytes were purified from PBMCs by positive selection using anti-CD14 magnetic beads as recommended by the manufacturer (Miltenyi Biotec). Monocytes were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated defined FBS (HyClone), penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), L-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 10 ng/mL human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; Peprotech).

!Sample_data_processing = FastQC was used to evaluate quality of sequenced reads (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc). Contaminated adaptor portions of sequenced reads were trimmed using the Trim Galore program (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore).
!Sample_data_processing = Sequenced reads were mapped to reference human genome (hg19 assembly) using STAR aligner (2.5.2b, Dobin et al., 2013 Bioinformatics) with default parameters.
!Sample_data_processing = Cufflinks version 2.2.1 (Trapnell et al., 2012 Nat Protoc) was used to estimate the abundance (RPKM) of transcripts.
