!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = Cultured CEM.NKR.DC-SIGN cells were washed with RPMI media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum prior to analysis. Populations of interest (total viable cells or surface DENV1 NS1 positive cells) were isolated by flow cytometric sorting using a BD FACSAria Fusion instrument. Post-sort population purity was assessed prior to downstream analysis. Sorted cells were washed in PBS supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum prior to scRNAseq library generation.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Single-cell RNAseq libraries were generated using the Chromium Single Cell 5' v2 Reagents Kit (10x Genomics) and the Chromium Single Cell Analyzer (10x Genomics) according to the manufacture's protocol (User guide RevC)
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Indexed sequencing libraries were generated using the Chromium Single Cell 5' v2 Reagents Kit (10x Genomics) according to the manufacture's protocol (User guide RevC). In short, sequencing libraries were generated by  1) transcript fragmentation and end-repair, 2) post-fragmentation size-selection using SPRIselect beads, 3) Adaptor ligation and 4) sample index PCR and SPRIselect cleanup
