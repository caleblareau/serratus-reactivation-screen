!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Total RNA was isolated from human islets using RNeasy spin columns according to the manufacturerâ€™s directions (Qiagen). RNA quantity was determined using a Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific) and the quality assessed by a Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Total mouse RNA was used for RNA-sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000.
