!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Briefly, 500ng of total RNA was ribo depleted, fragmented and went under first and second strand synthesis, A tailing, adapter ligation and PCR amplification (using 11 cycles).  Final libraries were quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems), Qubit Fluorometer (Life Technologies) and Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer.

!Sample_data_processing = Short reads in fastQ format are processed using RAPiD, which is a RNA-Seq analysis framework developed and maintained by the Technology Development group at Icahn Institute for Genomics and MultiScale Biology. .
!Sample_data_processing = RAPiD uses STAR to map the short reads to the  [hg19 ] reference and resultant alignment map in BAM format is quantified for gene level expression using featureCounts of the subreads package. Detailed QC metrics are generated using the RNASeQC package
