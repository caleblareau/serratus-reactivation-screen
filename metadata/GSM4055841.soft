!Sample_data_processing = Trimming adaptor sequences and removing reads of low quality were performed by cutadapt (v2.3).
!Sample_data_processing = Quantified reads were aligned to the human genome (GRCh38.p12) by STAR (v2.6.1a) and then gene-level read counts were generated based on the annotations of Gencode (v28).
