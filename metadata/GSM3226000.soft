!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = HeLa cells and MEFs were stimulated with TNFÎ± (20 ng/ml) for 60 min
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = HeLa and MEF cells were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with FCS and Penicillin/Streptomycin.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = total RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = For RNA-Seq cells were harvested and total RNA was isolated using the NucleoSpin RNA Kit (Macherey-Nagel).  For ChIP-Seq samples were crosslinked using Formaldehyde, Sonicated and chromatin was extracted using the p65 Antibody. DNA was purified NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean UP Kit with buffer NTB (Macherey-Nagel).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA-Seq libraries were prepared from total RNA using the TruSeq Stranded total RNA LT kit (Illumina). ChIP-Seq libraries were prepared from purified ChIP DNA with the Microplex Library Preparation Kit (Diagenode)
!Sample_data_processing = RNA-Seq data were aligned to hg38 or mm10 using RNA STAR using a gffread filtered gencode annotation file. Normalized reads were obtained using cufflinks.
