!Sample_data_processing = Bases were called with the Illumina CASAVA 1.7 pipeline
!Sample_data_processing = Read library quality was assessed using fastqc (FastQC 2016) and multiqc (Ewels 2016) packages.
!Sample_data_processing = Illumina adapters were removed (R1: TACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT, R2: GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT) and leading and trailing low quality bases (below quality 30) were trimmed using Trimmomatic (Bolger 2014).  Reads which were less than 36 bases long after these steps were dropped.
!Sample_data_processing = The expression of the genes was quantified using Salmon (Patro, Duggal, Love, Irizarry, & Kingsford, 2017) with index built from the GENCODE v27 transcriptome.
!Sample_data_processing = The counts matrix was then normalized using in-house bioinformatics software package de_toolkitâ€™s deseq2 method.
!Sample_data_processing = The counts of the genes were extracted and plotted with ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016).
