!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols
!Sample_data_processing = Basecalls performed using CASAVA version 1.8.2
!Sample_data_processing = Sequenced reads were trimmed for adaptor, low-quality, and artifact sequence, then mapped to hg19 Tophat v.2.0.9 with parameters -p 4 --b2-very-sensitive
!Sample_data_processing = Reads Per Kilobase of exon per Megabase of library size (RPKM) were calculated using bam2rpkm v.0.06 from the University of Liverpool. In short, exons from all isoforms of a gene were merged to create one meta-transcript. The number of reads falling in the exons of this meta-transcript were counted and normalized by the size of the meta-transcript and by the size of the library.
