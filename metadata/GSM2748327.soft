!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = GBM tissues were obtained from excess surgical materials from patients at the Cleveland Clinic after neuropathology review with appropriate consent, in accordance with an IRB-approved protocol (2559). To prevent culture-induced drift, patient-derived subcutaneous xenografts were generated and maintained as a recurrent source of tumor cells for study. Upon xenografts removal, a papain dissociation system (Worthington Biochemical) was used to dissociate tumors according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Cells were then cultured in Neurobasal medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 1x B27 without vitamin A (ThermoFisher), L-glutamine (ThermoFisher), sodium pyruvate (ThermoFisher), 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) (R&D Systems).
