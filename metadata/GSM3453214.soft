!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = A549 H2B-mCherry infected or MOCK infected cells were detached from the cell culture plates using trypsin-EDTA 0.05% (Gibco), washed with cell culture media and passed through a 40 mM cell strainer to prepare single-cell suspensions, and the final concentration was set at 1,000 cells/ml.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Single-cell gel beads in emulsion (GEMs) were generated using the 10X Genomics Chromium system following the Single Cell 3â€™ Reagents Kits V2 recommendations. The 10X chip was loaded to target 5,000 cells final. Reverse-transcription was performed in the emulsion and cDNA was amplified for 12 cycles before library construction. Each library was tagged with a different index for multiplexing. Quality control and quantification of the amplified cDNA were assessed by Bioanalyzer. Library quality control were evaluated by Bioanalyzer, Qubit and Kappa assays.
