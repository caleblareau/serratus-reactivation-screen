!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at  -80℃ until further use.RNA was harvested using Trizol reagent.  NEBNext® Ultra™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA) was used with 1 ug of total RNA for the construction of sequencing libraries.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = rRNAs were removed from Total RNA using Epicentre Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (illumina, USA) and fragmented to approximately 200bp. Subsequently, the purified  RNAs were subjected to first strand and second strand cDNA synthesis following by adaptor ligation and enrichment with a low-cycle according to instructions of NEBNext® Ultra™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA).
