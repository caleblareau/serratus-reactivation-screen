!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Treated cells were sorted as P1, P2, and P3 subsets depending on extra-cellular markers: P1 (PD-L1+CD80-), P2 (PD-L1+CD80+) and P3 (PD-L1-CD80+). 1 micro-gram Total RNA-seq was extracted for library preparation.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Libraries were constructed using the "TruSeq Stranded Total RNA-seq" for paired-end sequencing.
!Sample_description = P2-d2
!Sample_data_processing = Sequencing reads were aligned to the human genome hg19 build using Tophat (Trapnell et al., 2009) (version 2.0.6) with parameters -N 3 --read-edit-dist 3 -r 155 --mate-std-dev 80 -p 12 --library-type fr-firststrand -g 2.
!Sample_data_processing = Gene level counts were computed using htseq-count (Anders et al., 2015) (version 0.6.1p1) with parameters -t exon -s reverse -m intersection-nonempty.
!Sample_data_processing = Genes annotated as protein coding in Gencode V15 were analyzed separately as coding genes.
!Sample_data_processing = Differential gene expression analysis was performed in R (version 3.1.3) using the DEseq2 package (Love et al.,2014).
!Sample_data_processing = Genes that had a mean of reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) across all samples under 2 RPKM were filtered out.
!Sample_data_processing = For each pDC population, genes that show absolute log2 fold change > 1, and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value < 0.01 as estimated using a Wald test, with respect to at least one other pDC population, were considered differentially expressed.
