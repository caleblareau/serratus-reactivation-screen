!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 1 Î¼g of total RNA was enriched for the Poly-A mRNA and reverse transcribed to double-stranded cDNA. The cDNA was end repaired, adenylated, and ligated with Illumina indexes prior to 12 cycles of PCR. Sequencing was performed using 12pM hybridization to a 2x100 paired end flow cell.

!Sample_data_processing = Illumina Casava1.7 software used for basecalling.
!Sample_data_processing = Sequenced reads were trimmed for adaptor sequence, and masked for low-complexity or low-quality sequence, then mapped to hg38 whole genome using bowtie v0.12.2 with parameters -q -p 4 -e 100 -y -a -m 10 --best --strata
!Sample_data_processing = Reads Per Kilobase of exon per Megabase of library size (RPKM) were calculated using a protocol from Chepelev et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2009. In short, exons from all isoforms of a gene were merged to create one meta-transcript. The number of reads falling in the exons of this meta-transcript were counted and normalized by the size of the meta-transcript and by the size of the library.
