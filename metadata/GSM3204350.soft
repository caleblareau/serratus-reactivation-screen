!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Library preparation and sequencing for RNA samples were performed at Genewiz (South Plainfield, NJ). Briefly, the quality of the total RNA was assessed using Nanodrop 2000, Qubit RNA Assay, and TapeStation). One round of polyA+ selection was performed for RNA samples, followed by conversion to cDNAs. The mRNA library was generated using NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep KitA as per manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The indexed DNA libraries were quantitated using qPCR in a Roche LightCycler 480 with the Kapa Biosystems kit for library quantitation (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA) prior to cluster generation.

!Sample_data_processing = Basecalls performed using CASAVA version 1.8.4
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, paired-end sequencing was performed on an HiSeq 2500 sequencer (Illumina), and sequences reported as FASTQ files. All reads were aligned to the human genome (GRCh38/hg19) using TopHat (v2.1.1). Low quality mapped reads (MQ<30) were removed from the analysis. Mappable reads were counted with HTSeq (v.0.6.1). All the read count tables were then normalized based on ____and imported into R Studio software for differential gene expression using DESeq2 (v3.0).  Genes with mean count across all groups >30 were chosen for visualization. For heatmap, genes with a difference expression p value < 0.05 were selected. Venn diagrams were generated using jvenn: an interactive Venn diagram viewer (Bardou, et. al., jvenn: an interactive Venn diagram viewer. BMC Bioinformatics 2014, 15:293 doi:10.1186/1471-2105-15-293).
