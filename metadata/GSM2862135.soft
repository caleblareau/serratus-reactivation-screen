!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = Plated cells were first transfected with 1.5 μg/1x106 cells of pDeltaF6 helper plasmid. After 4 h, cells were washed once with serum-free DMEM and incubated with AAV2/2 vectors (m.o.i. 5x104 GC/cell of each vector) in a final volume of 700 µl of serum-free DMEM. Two hours later, 1.3 ml of complete DMEM were added to the cells.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Total RNA was extracted using the RT–PCR RNeasy MiniKit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). RNA (500 ng) was submitted to DNase I digestion (Qiagen) and 20 μl cDNA was generated using the SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase kit (Thermo Fisher) using oligo dT primers.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = A total of 47.5 ng of RNA was used as input for the synthesis of cDNA with the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara). Manufacturer suggested protocol was followed, with minor modifications. The second strand synthesis of cDNA was performed by replacing the SMART-Seq v4 Oligo with custom primers, specific for the transgenes of interest [CDH23 oligo – 5’-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTacttgttgatctccgaagataccc-3’; ALMS1 oligo – 5’-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTtagtggtggaggaagtagaggag-3’ (bp in capital letters belong to the RNAseq adapter)]. Seventy-five pg of cDNA generated with SMART-Seq v4 Kit were used for library preparation using the NEXTERA XT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina), following suggested protocol.
