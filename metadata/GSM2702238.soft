!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = cells were stimulated with Salmonella typhimurium LPS at a concentration of 100 ng / ml for 4 h. Samples 1-8: Cells were pre-incubated with DMSO or inhibitors for 2 h prior to LPS-stimulation
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = peripheral blood derived CD14+ monocytes (MACS enrichement) were differentiated in cell culture plastic multi-well plates (4*10e5 cell per 12-well, 1 ml of medium per well) using X-Vivo-15 medium supplemented with 5 % FCS and 20 ng / ml of recombinant human GM-CSF for 8 days

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cells were washed once with PBS and RNA was extracted with Trizol. For subcellular fractionation cells were lysed with mild detergent buffer and nuclei and cytosol were seperated by centrifugation at low speed. Cytosol was cleared from remaining nuclei by high speed centrifugation and nuclear fraction was carefully washed twice with mild detergent buffer before RNA-Extraction with Trizol.
