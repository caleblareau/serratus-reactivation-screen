!Sample_data_processing = RNA-Seq data: Reads were mapped to hg19 and transcriptome reference with TopHat 2 (version 2.0.9). TopHat 2 was run using default parameters but with the coverage search being turned off. The mapped reads were analyzed by Cufflinks (version 2.1.1). Differential expression was estimated with Cuffdiff (version 2.1.1).
