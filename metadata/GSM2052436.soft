!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = The adenovirus against human miR-508/508/509/514 mimics and miR-508 mimics were introduced into the HCT116 colorectal cells, while nonspecific microRNA virus was used as negative controls.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = The human colorectal cancer cells HCT116 were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum at 37 Â°C in an atmosphere of 5 % CO2.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = total RNA of HCT116 cells with different treatment was harvested using Trizol reagent. Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Cat#FC-122-1001) was used with 1 ug of total RNA for the construction of sequencing libraries.

!Sample_data_processing = Reads were mapped to the human genome (hg19) using TopHat v2.0.11 (http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu) with the following default options with a TopHat transcript index built from Ensembl_GRCh37. Transcript expression was estimated with an improved version of Cuffdiff2 (http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu). Cuffdiff was run with the default options against the UCSC iGenomes GTF file from Illumina (available at http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/igenomes.html).
