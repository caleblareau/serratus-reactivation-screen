!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols
!Sample_data_processing = bcl2fastq 1.8.4 was used for base calling
!Sample_data_processing = Reads were aligned to hg19 genome using TopHat v2.0.9 with parameters -p 6 --library-type fr-firststrand --no-coverage-search
!Sample_data_processing = DUST wcores were calculated with PRINSEQ Lite (v 0.20.3) and low-complexity reads( DUSC >4) were removed from the BAM files
!Sample_data_processing = After removing multi mapped reads with low-complexity reads, SAM files were generated from BAM files with SAMtools (v 1.1). Gene specific read counts were obtained with HTSeq-count v.0.5.4 using 'union" option.
