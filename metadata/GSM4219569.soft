!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Total RNA was isolated from kidney cortex from five male patients at each condition using mirVanaâ„¢ miRNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher, Inc., Seoul, Korea). Samples with RNA integrity numbers > 7 were prepared using Illumina TruSeq Standard mRNA Prep kit (Catalog # RS-122-2103; Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols
!Sample_data_processing = FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) was performed to assess the quality of RNA-seq.
!Sample_data_processing = RNA-seq data were quantified by salmon with parameters -p 8 --seqBias --gcBias --useVBOpt --numBootstraps 30 --validateMappings
!Sample_data_processing = The abundance of the transcripts in the samples was calculated to obtain both TPM (Transcripts Per Million) and the un-normalized counts of sequencing reads.
!Sample_data_processing = Differential expression analysis was performed using R (version 3.5.1) with DESeq2 Bioconductor package
