!Sample_data_processing = Prior to alignment, linker and polyA sequences were removed from the 3â€™ ends of reads.
!Sample_data_processing = Bowtie v0.12.7 (allowing up to 2 mismatches) was used to perform the alignments. First, reads that aligned to human rRNA sequences were discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = All remaining reads were aligned to the human genome hg19
!Sample_data_processing = Still-unaligned reads were aligned to 200bp sequences that spanned splice junctions
!Sample_data_processing = wig files were then generated by summing the numbers of reads obtained from each position in the human genome. For this each read was counted once, for the mRNA samples the 5' end of each read was used, for the ribosome footprints samples the caculated postion of the ribosome P-site was used.
