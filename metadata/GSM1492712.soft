!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.  Where necessary, EBV-negativ GC cells were in vitro infected with AKATA EBV strain which was tagged with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). Infected cells were sorted by flow cytometry and plated in the same culture media. Cells in log phase growth were subjected to RNA isolation

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = The Illumina (IL) library libraries were prepared using mRNA-Seq 8 sample prep kit (Illumina Inc. San Diego, USA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. For HTR library preparations, mRNA isolation with both Dynabeads (Invitrogen) and Sera-Mag oligo dT magnetic beads (Thermo Scientific, Cat. # 3815-2103-010150) were performed based on the Dynabeads mRNA direct kit (Invitrogen) protocol with minor adjustments.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = All samples were purified and multiplexed using eight of the three-nucleotide barcoded adapters, randomly assigned to three different pools with eight samples per pool.
