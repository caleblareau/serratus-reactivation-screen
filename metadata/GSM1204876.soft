!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 15% FBS, 2mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100ug/mL streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37Â°C with 5% CO2 . Cells were split every 2-3 days.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = total RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit. Libraries were constucted with the Illumina TruSeq kit.  Libraries were subsequently sequenced on a Hi-Seq 2000 by standard protocol.
!Sample_data_processing = Reads were aligned to the genome using BWA v0.5.9.
!Sample_data_processing = Reads not mapping to the genome, mapping ambiguously, or mapping with a quality score less than 10 were filtered out with SAMtools v0.1.18.
!Sample_data_processing = The number of reads overlapping a single exon from a defined set of orthologous exons (available at http://gilad.uchicago.edu/orthoExon) were counted.
!Sample_data_processing = The read counts were used to calculate the reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM).
!Sample_data_processing = To facilitate comparisons with mass spec. data, the RPKM measures for an internal reference cell line (GM19238) were used to calculate a log2-ratio of expression measurements.
!Sample_data_processing = Genome_build: hg19, panTro3 and rheMac2
!Sample_data_processing = Supplementary_files_format_and_content: .txt files: Each line represents a gene. Column 1 contains the Ensembl gene ID. Column 2 contains the RPKM measure for that gene in that individual.
