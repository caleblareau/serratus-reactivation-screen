!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = For each sample, RNA was extracted from a 75 cm2 flask of HFFs infected at moi 10 or mock-infected using an RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Poly(A) RNA was enriched using a Poly(A)Purist MAG kit (Thermo). 250 ng of poly(A) RNA from each sample was used to prepare a cDNA library using a PrepX RNA-Seq Library Kit (Wafergen biosystems) on an Apollo 324 (WaferGen biosystems), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The following barcode sequences were used: Mock1 (ATCACGAT); Mock2 (CGATGTAT); Mock3 (TTAGGCAT); 24h_1 (TGACCAAT); 24h_2 (ACAGTGAT); 24h_3 (GCCAATAT); 72h_1 (CAGATCAT); 72h_2 (ACTTGAAT); 72h_3 (GATCAGAT). The resulting libraries were quantified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), then were pooled for sequencing on a single lane of Illumina HiSeq2500 (1 Ã— 50 bp reads).

!Sample_data_processing = Reads were aligned to the Human genome (hg19) and HCMV Merlin strain genome (NC_006273.2) using the aligner STAR version 2.5.2b (Dobin et al., Bioinformatics, 2013; Fonseca et al., bioRxiv, 2014).
!Sample_data_processing = Read counts for each gene/transcript were determined using HTSeq version 0.61 (Anders et al., Bioinformatics, 2015) with the following optional parameters: --m union,-r pos,-i transcript_id,-a 10,--stranded=no.
!Sample_data_processing = For human genes, normalization assumed equal human reads per run; HCMV reads were not included in this normalization since by 72 h HCMV accounted for a significant proportion of all reads (0h: <0.01%, 24 h: 4.7-5.8%; 72 h: 41.8-42.3% HCMV reads).
!Sample_data_processing = For HCMV, reads for each barcode were normalized assuming equal total reads (human plus HCMV) per sequencing run. Reads per Kilobase per Million (RPKM) values were calculated in Excel.
