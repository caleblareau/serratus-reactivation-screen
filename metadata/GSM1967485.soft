!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = EBV infection was performed with MOI of 0.1 GRU (Green Raji Unit).
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = B-lymphocytes were prepared from adenoid biopsies, infected with EBV, incubated for 5 days with Cyclosporin A.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Samples were disolved in Trizol and Direct-Zol RNA kit (Zymo Research) were used for RNA extraction.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = For total RNA, rRNA were depleted and cDNA libraries were prepared using random primers.
!Sample_data_processing = Sequence reads were trimmed and filtered for low quality sequences using the RawReadManipulator (unpublished)
!Sample_data_processing = RISC-IP reads were mapped using bwa-0.7.12. For RNA-Seq reads STAR 2.4.0 was used. STAR index was build using a hybrid gtf version of the human gencode 19 and EBV AJ507799.2
!Sample_data_processing = Read counts were created using FeatureCounts (subread v1.4.6) and the hybrid hg19_ebv gtf.
