!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Total RNA from ICC tissue samples was extracted by TRIzol (Sigma, USA). Briefly, 2 Î¼g of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA with the PrimeScript RT Master Mix (RR037A, TaKaRa, Japan), following the standard protocols provided by the manufacturer.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols
!Sample_data_processing = Illumina Casava1.7 software used for basecalling.
!Sample_data_processing = Sequenced reads were trimmed for adaptor sequence, and masked for low-complexity or low-quality sequence
!Sample_data_processing = The TopHat (v2.0.10) was used to align reads to human reference genome (hg19 release) and RefSeq annotated genes, and to discover transcript splice sites.
!Sample_data_processing = The Cufflinks (v2.1.1) was used to estimate the gene expression levels based on the map generated by TopHat.
!Sample_data_processing = The expression levels for each gene were normalized to fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) to facilitate the comparison of transcript levels among samples.
