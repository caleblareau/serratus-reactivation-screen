!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Ribosome footprint profiling experiments were performed using ARTseqTM Ribosome Profiling kit for mammalian cells (RPHMR12126) following vendorâ€™s instructions. Cell lysates were prepared from flash frozen pellets of 30 to 50 million live cells by repeat pipetting in 1 ml cold lysis buffer. Sephacryl S400 spin column (GE; 27-5140-01) was used for monosome isolation. For rRNA depletion, Ribo-Zero Magnetic Kit (Epicentre; MRZH11124) was used.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Ribosome footprint cDNA libraries were PCR amplified (12 to 15 thermo-cycles) and barcoded using ScriptMiner Index PCR Primers (Epicentre; SMIP2124). Indexed libraries were pooled to sequence on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.
!Sample_data_processing = Raw data provided are fastq files after the following processing. FASTX-Toolkit were used to clip the adaptor sequence and trim the 5' most base for each read. Reads that are shorter than 22-nt or that are mapped to rRNA, tRNA, snoRNA using bowtie were removed from the file.
!Sample_data_processing = Processed reads are then map to human genome (hg19) using tophat. Uniquely mapped reads are used to intersect with Ensembl gene annotation using BEDTools to get read count per gene for each individual.
!Sample_data_processing = Genome_build: hg19
!Sample_data_processing = Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Processed data file contains read count per Ensembl gene for each individual. It is organized with one individual per column and one gene per row.
