!Sample_data_processing = we used Minimap2 v2.17 with iso-seq settings for mapping the PacBio data
!Sample_data_processing = TranscriptClean v2.0.2 was used on mapped PacBio data without mismatch correction. The splice junction file was obtained using GENCODE v29 using one of the accesory scripts
!Sample_data_processing = TALON v4.4.2 was used for annotation and quantification of PacBio data. The database was initialized with GENCODE v29
!Sample_data_processing = We used STAR 2.6 to map Illumina TUC-seq reads to Hg38 build
!Sample_data_processing = We created sub-categories of the illumina TUC-seq data based on the number of T to C substitutions in the reads to 4 groups: all reads, reads with > 2 , > 4 and > 6 T to C
!Sample_data_processing = For each categories in illumina data we counted the abundance for each transcript in gencode v29 annotation file using express v1.5.1
!Sample_data_processing = Genome_build: hg38
!Sample_data_processing = Supplementary_files_format_and_content: TXT table format, Pacbio abundance files generated by TALON and Illumina abundances generated by eXpress for each category of reads
