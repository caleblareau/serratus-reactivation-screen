!Sample_data_processing = FASTQ reads were trimmed using fastq-mcf (ea-utils, v.1.1.2) to remove SMARTer adapter sequences.
!Sample_data_processing = Reads were aligned in Galaxy using bowtie and TopHat (Tophat for Illumina tool, v.1.5.0); duplicate alignments were marked and removed using Picard MarkDuplicates.
!Sample_data_processing = Read counts per Ensembl gene ID were estimated in Galaxy using htseq-count (htseq-count tool, v.0.4.1).
!Sample_data_processing = Sequencing, alignment, and quantitation metrics were obtained for FASTQ, BAM/SAM, and count files in Galaxy using FastQC, Picard, TopHat, Samtools, and htseq-count.
