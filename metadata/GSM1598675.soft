!Sample_data_processing = Illumina HiSeq 2000 for sequencing.
!Sample_data_processing = Reads were aligned using TopHat, using hg19 as the reference genome and mapping reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) as output.
!Sample_data_processing = RPKM were normalized using the DESeq algorithm using Avaids NGS software, where normalized counts were log2-transformed and base-lined to the median expression of control samples.
!Sample_data_processing = Normalized expression values were baselined to the median of all samples.
!Sample_data_processing = We removed all transcripts that did not have at least 5 RPKM in at least 5 different samples.
