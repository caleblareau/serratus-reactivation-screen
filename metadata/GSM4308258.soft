!Sample_data_processing = Low quality reads were removed by using fastq_quality_fileter (fastx_toolkit v0.0.14) with parameters -q 20 -p 80
!Sample_data_processing = Reads were aligned to hg19 genome assembly with Hisat v2.2.1.0 for RNA-Seq and Bowtie2 (version 2.2.3) for ChIP-Seq.
!Sample_data_processing = Reads with more than two mismatches were removed form aligned reads for RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq. Then, multiply mapped reads were removed for ChIP-Seq followed by PCR duplicates by using picard-tools-1.1119.
!Sample_data_processing = Fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped fragments (FPKM) were calculated using Cufflinks v2.2.1for RNA-seq. Reads on black list regions (wgEncodeDacMapabilityConsensusExcludable.bed) were removed and remaing reads were converted to BedGraph format with HOMER v4.9.1 for ChIP-seq.
