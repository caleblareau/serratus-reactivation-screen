!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = hTERT-RPE1 cells were synchronized with 400 uM Mimosine treatment for 22hrs.
!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = hTERT-RPE1 cells were transfected with 130-150 pmol LNA GapMeRs with the facilitation of Lipofectamine RNAiMax in Opti-MEM.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = hTERT-RPE1 cells were grown in regular RPE1 medium at 37Â° C, 5% CO2.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA-seq: hTERT-RPE1 cells were collected in Trizol reagent, extracted with chloroform and precipitated with isopropanol. DNaseI treated RNA samples were then extracted using RNA clean & concentrator kit, Zymo Research.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = ChIP-seq: hTERT-RPE1 cells were washed once with PBS and crosslinked with 1% Formaldehyde for 10 min at room temparature for ChIP experiments. Chromatin was extracted in 1% SDS containg lysis buffer and sonicated.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cut&Run: hTERT-RPE1 cells were washed once with PBS and crosslinked with 1% Formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and Cut&Run protocol was performed as described in Skene PJ et al., 2017.
