!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Fresh blood was collected and granulocytes were extracted from the left over pellet after Ficoll purification by lysing RBCs with RBC lysis buffer. Granulocytes were then washed 3X with DNAse- and RNAse-free PBS and then lysed in RLT/bME buffer. After a 30min incubation at 4 degrees, RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNA preparation kit.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Reverse transcription was performed followed by PCR amplification to generate full length amplified cDNA. Sequencing libraries were constructed using the NexteraXT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina) to generate Illumina-compatible barcoded libraries. Libraries were pooled and quantified using a QubitÂ® Fluorometer (Life Technologies).

!Sample_data_processing = Base-calling was performed using CASAVA v.1.8.2.
!Sample_data_processing = FASTQ reads were trimmed using fastq-mcf (ea-utils, v.1.1.2) to remove SMARTer adapter sequences.
!Sample_data_processing = Reads were aligned in Galaxy using STAR aligner; duplicate alignments were marked and removed using Picard MarkDuplicates.
!Sample_data_processing = Read counts per Ensembl gene ID were estimated in Galaxy using htseq-count (htseq-count tool, v.0.4.1).
!Sample_data_processing = Sequencing, alignment, and quantitation metrics were obtained for FASTQ, BAM/SAM, and count files in Galaxy using FastQC, Picard, STAR, Samtools, and htseq-count.
