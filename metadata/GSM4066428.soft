!Sample_data_processing = Raw read counts were obtained using featurecounts from the subread1.5.0p3 package and gencode 25 human gene annotations using only uniquely aligned reads (default) and including multi-mapping reads (-M)
!Sample_data_processing = Sequence reads were cleaned and adapter trimmed using trimmomatic-0.36
!Sample_data_processing = Each sample was mapped individually to the human reference genome (GRCh38.p7, primary assembly + gencode 25 annotation) with STAR2.5.2b
!Sample_data_processing = DESeq2-1.14.1 within R-3.3.2 was used to perform data normalization and differential expression analysis with a false-discovery rate adjusted p-value threshold of 0.05 on each set of raw expression measures.
