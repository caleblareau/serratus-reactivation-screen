!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Following surgical excision of tumor, necrotic debris and sampled cavitary lesions were removed to include a sufficient solid component.  Next, the surgeon cut a 3-5-mm-thick slice along the longest axis of the excised tissue, which was frozen within 30 minutes of excision and later retrieved for RNA extraction
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = For library preparation, the TruSeq Total Stranded RNA with Ribo-Zero Reduction (Illumina) was used following manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
!Sample_data_processing = Raw reads preprocessing and quality control:
!Sample_data_processing = a. Paired-end reads were filtered and trimmed using software Trimmomatic
!Sample_data_processing = b. Quality control before and after raw reads preprocessing was done using software FastQC
!Sample_data_processing = Raw reads alignment:
!Sample_data_processing = a. Trimmed fastq reads were aligned to human hg19 reference genome using software TopHat2 and indexed with SAMtools.
!Sample_data_processing = b. RNAseq alignment QC metrics were collected using software PICARD
!Sample_data_processing = Transcripts assembly and expression estimation:
!Sample_data_processing = a. Gene and isoform assembly and expression level estimation was done using Cufflinks.
