!Sample_data_processing = Illumina Casava1.8 software used for basecalling.
!Sample_data_processing = Raw data (raw reads) of fastq format were firstly processed through in-house perl scripts. In this step, clean data(clean reads) were obtained by removing reads containing adapter, reads containing ploy-N and low quality reads from raw data. At the same time, Q20, Q30, GC-content and sequence duplication level of the clean data were calculated. All the downstream analyses were based on clean data with high quality
!Sample_data_processing = The expression of transcripts was quantified as reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM). Subsequently, gene enrichment analysis was conducted using the DAVID tool.
