!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = MKN7_WT, MKN7_EB, NCC24 and SNU719 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 containing penicillin-streptomycin, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = total RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = ChIP samples were purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and total RNAs were collected using RNeasy (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Libraries were prepared using NEBNext ChIP-Seq Library Preparation Set for Illumina (New England Biolabs) for ChIP-seq. TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) were used for RNA-seq following the manufacturerâ€™s protocol.
!Sample_data_processing = Low quality reads were removed by using fastq_quality_fileter (fastx_toolkit v0.0.14) with parameters -q 20 -p 80
!Sample_data_processing = Reads were aligned to hg19 genome assembly with Hisat v2.2.1.0 for RNA-Seq and Bowtie2 (version 2.2.3) for ChIP-Seq.
!Sample_data_processing = Reads with more than two mismatches were removed form aligned reads for RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq. Then, multiply mapped reads were removed for ChIP-Seq followed by PCR duplicates by using picard-tools-1.1119.
!Sample_data_processing = Fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped fragments (FPKM) were calculated using Cufflinks v2.2.1for RNA-seq and Aligned reads were converted to BedGraph format with bedtools v2.20.1 for ChIP-seq.
!Sample_data_processing = Genome_build: hg19
!Sample_data_processing = Supplementary_files_format_and_content: tab-delimited text files include FPKM values for each Sample. Bedgraph files are generated from bedtools and converted to bigwig file.
