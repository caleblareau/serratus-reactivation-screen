!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = MO1043-ICN1-HA cells were induced to express ICN1-HA or eGFP with 1 ug/ml of Doxycycline for 36 hours; primary CLL cells were thawed in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich), penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 Î¼g/ml) and immediately harvested.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Total RNA was extracted from primary CLL cases with the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) with on column DNAse treatment and poly-A pull-down was performed to enrich mRNAs from total RNA.

!Sample_data_processing = Illumina Casava1.7 software used for basecalling.
!Sample_data_processing = RTA (Illumina) was used for base calling and bcl2fastq (version 1.8.4) for converting BCL to fastq format, coupled with adaptor trimming.
!Sample_data_processing = Reads were mapped to the human reference genome NCBI/build37.2 using Tophat (version 2.1.0) with 4 mismatches (--read-mismatches = 4) and 10 maximum multiple hits (--max-multihits = 10) to tackle the mapping issue of reads that are from exon-exon junctions.
!Sample_data_processing = Relative abundance of genes and splice isoforms was estimated using cufflinks (version 2.0.2) with default settings.
