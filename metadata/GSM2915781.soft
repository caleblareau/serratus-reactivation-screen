!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = B cells and monocytes cells were left uninfected, or were infected overnight with the Edmonston strain of MV at a multiplicity of infection 0.2. CD4+ T cells were co-cultured overnight with or without MV-infected monocytes, after which the CD4+ T cell isolation was repeated (on the mixed cultures) to ensure that the T cell samples were not contaminated with monocytes. The purity of the cells was ascertained using flow cytometry.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Cryopreserved PBMCs/cells were thawed and cultured using standard procedures. B cells and monocytes were purified using a human CD19 MicroBeads positive selection kit (Miltenyi Biotec; San Diego, CA) and a human CD14 MicroBeads positive selection kit (Miltenyi Biotec), respectively. CD4+ T cells were isolated using the CD4+T Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Total RNA (including miRNA) from B and T cells was extracted using miRNeasy Mini Kits (Qiagen; Valencia, CA) according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = cDNA libraries were created according to the Illumina TruSeq miRNA procedure for small RNAs and combined with Illumina adaptor sequences. miRNA products were PCR-enriched and purified.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Illumina TruSeq miRNA library construction.
!Sample_description = cDNA libraries were created from total RNA according to manufacturer's instructions and combined with Illumina adaptor sequences using standard procedures. Twelve samples were multiplexed in each lane. Lanes were balanced by cell type, immune response status and sex. Single-end read sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2000.
