!Sample_molecule_ch1 = polyA RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Total RNAs were subsequently isolated using PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturerâ€™s manual. An in-column DNA digestion step was included to remove any residual genomic DNA contamination
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = To construct RNA-seq libraries, 500 ng total RNA was used for polyA mRNA-selection using NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (#E7490, New England Biolabs, Inc.  Ipswich, MA), followed by library construction via NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (#E7530, New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA).

!Sample_data_processing = Adaptor-trimmed Illumina reads for each individual library were mapped back to the human GRCh37.83 transcriptome assembly using Salmon v0.14.0
!Sample_data_processing = Quant file was used to estimate the number of reads mapped to each contig. Only transcripts with at least 5 cumulative mapping counts were used in this analysis.
!Sample_data_processing = DESeq2 v1.14.1 was used to evaluate gene differential expression (DE)
!Sample_data_processing = Each DE analysis was composed of a pairwise comparison between experimental group and the control group. Differentially expressed genes were identified after a correction for false discovery rate (FDR 0.05).
