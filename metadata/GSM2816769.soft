!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = HBTEC were grown until they reached confluence. Cells were then incubated 3 days more without addition of fresh media and were either mock infected or infected with the indicated Ad5-based vectors for 24h in the conditioned medium.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Human Bronchial/Tracheal Epithelial Cells (HBTEC, Lifeline Cell Technology Cat# FC-0035; lot# 02196) were grown at 37Â°C in BronchiaLife Medium Complete Kit (Lifeline Cell Technology catalog number: LL-0023) in a 5% CO2 incubator

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 1X10^6 Low-passage HBTEC were mock-infected or infected with Ad5 vectors 3 days after reaching confluence. RNA was isolated 24h p.i. using QIAGEN RNeasy Plus Mini Kit. Eluted RNA was treated with Ambion DNA-free DNA Removal Kit and then Ambion TRIzol reagent, precipitated with isopropanol, and dissolved in sterile water. RNA concentration was measured with a Qubit fluorometer.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = One microgram of RNA was fragmented and copied into DNA then PCR amplified with bar-coded primers for separate samples to prepare sequencing libraries using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation procedure.
!Sample_data_processing = Sequences were aligned to the hg19 human genome sequence using TopHat v2.
!Sample_data_processing = FPKM (fragments per kb per million mapped reads) for each annotated hg19 RefSeq gene ID was determined using Cuffdiff v2 from Cufflinks RNA-Seq analysis tools at http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu.
