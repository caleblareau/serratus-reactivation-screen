!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = 24 h of normoxia or hypoxia (0.1-0.2%O2).
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Lonza and cultured in EBM-2 (Lonza) supplemented with hEGF, hydrocortisone, VEGF, hFGF-B, R3-IGF-1, ascorbic acid, gentamicin/amphotericin-B and 10% FBS under standard cell culture conditions (37Â°C, 5% CO2).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = rRNA was removed from the total RNA; RNA was fragmented into short fragments by the fragmentation buffer; cDNA was synthesized by random hexamer-primer; double-strand cDNA was purified with QiaQuick PCR extraction kit; sequencing adaptors were ligated to the fragments.

!Sample_data_processing = Reads were mapped on the hg19 genome via the STAR 2-pass method (version 2.3.0e_r291) with default parameters.
!Sample_data_processing = Potential splice junctions were extracted by the first mapping pass from all sequenced libraries and used to improve the second mapping pass.
!Sample_data_processing = Mapped reads were counted strand-specifically on the exon-level and subsequently summarized on the gene-level via featureCounts v1.4.3-p1 using the protein-coding genes of the EnsEMBL GRCh37 gene catalog for mRNA and the lncipedia 2.1 catalog for lncRNAs.
!Sample_data_processing = Genes were tested for differential expression using DESeq2 1.6.3, comparing fragment counts of the three hypoxia libraries to the three normoxia libraries.
!Sample_data_processing = Genes which resulted in Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values < 0.05 were considered significant.
