!Sample_data_processing = adaptors of RNA-seq and ribosome profiling reads were trimmed using FASTX Toolkit (v0.0.13.2). The tRNA and rRNA reads were removed by Bowtie (v1.0.1, -l 20). The reads were mapped to both the human genome (Ensembl, GRCh37) and the EV71 genome (GenBank, AB469182.1) using Tophat (v2.0.11).
!Sample_data_processing = Raw counts of protein-coding genes were quantified by HTSeq (v0.6.1p2). Raw counts of the host genes and the EV71 genes were combined and RPKMs (reads per kilobase of transcript per million reads) were calculated by edgeR.
