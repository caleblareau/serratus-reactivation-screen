!Sample_data_processing = QC-passed reads were aligned to hg19 using MapSplice (Wang et al., 2010).
!Sample_data_processing = Picard Tools v1.64 was used to determine the alignment profile.
!Sample_data_processing = Aligned reads were sorted and indexed using SAMtools and translated to transcriptome coordinates and filtered for indels, large inserts, and zero mapping quality using UBU v1.0 (Li et al., 2009).
!Sample_data_processing = Transcript abundance estimates were performed using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm (Li, 2011).
