!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Factory RNA was isolated as described in Melnik et al., Nat Protco, 2016, and subsequently purified using Tri-Zol reagent according to the manufacturers instructions (Thermo Fisher).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina RiboMinus/TruSeq protocols.
!Sample_data_processing = Raw sequencing reads were mapped to human Hg19 reference genome with STAR (vSTAR-2.5.3a)
!Sample_data_processing = Gene level counting was performed with iRNA-seq pipeline using count mode (iRNA-v1.1)
!Sample_data_processing = The count values were normalized based on the mean of the two replicates divided by the length of the gene
