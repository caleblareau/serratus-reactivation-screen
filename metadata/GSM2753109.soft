!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA was isolated from flow sorted B cell populations with the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Concentration and purity was analyzed on a Nanodrop 1000 Spectrophotometer. mRNA was isolated by oligo-dT beads and library was prepared using standard Illumina library protocol (Kit: RS-122-2101 TruSeqÂ® Stranded mRNA LT-SetA). Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq2500.
