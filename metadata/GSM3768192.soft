!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, catalog no. 15596-018) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Library preparations of polyadenylated RNAs were generated using the Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA library preparation kit and 100 base single-end sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer (University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center).
!Sample_data_processing = Gene expression levels were computed based on human (Ensembl v85) and EBV Akata (Genbank KC207813.1) transcriptomes.
!Sample_data_processing = Quantification was performed using Salmon (v. 0.8.2) run with default parameters.
