RNA was qunatified and then a reverse transcription step was done using Oligo dT primer and Clontech Reverse Transcriptase to generate cDNA. 2ug of cDNA was used for library preparation
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 2ug of cDNA was fragemented to 400bp using Covaris somicator. Following this, libraries for sequencing were prepared by subjecting the resulting DNA fragments to end-repair, 3â€² adenylation and ligation of TruSeq barcoded adapters. After ligation, DNA fragments were size selected using Ampure XP beads. A 0.75 ratio of beads to sample was used to select fragments larger than 200bp and avoid adapter dimers. These fragments were further amplified by PCR, cleaned using Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit and then once again size selected using Ampure XP beads with a 0.75 ratio of beads to sample. The final libraries were then quantified on Nanodrop and Bioanalyzer using Agilent's High Sensitivity DNA Analysis Kit. 10nM of each sample was then pooled together and the resulting pool was then sequenced single read 76bp length on the Illumina NextSeq
