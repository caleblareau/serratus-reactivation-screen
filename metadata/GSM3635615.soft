!Sample_data_processing = Reads were trimmed to remove adapters, low-quality reads, and reads less than 30 bases long using Trimmomatic (http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic)
!Sample_data_processing = The trimmed reads were aligned with the human (hg19 build) or mouse (mm10 build) using Tophat2 (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml).
!Sample_data_processing = Counts of reads aligned to each transcript were determined by Htseq-count (https://htseq.readthedocs.io/).
