!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = Cells were harvested, centrifuged, rinsed once with medium, and counted. 5 million cells were used for RNA-extraction
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = purification and expansion of neoplastic cells: The cells were isolated from pre-invasive neoplastic lesions of patients with earliest stage of invasive cancer. Cells were expanded in complete RPMI with 10% FBS and 2% penicillin and streptomicin for 10 days.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = total RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA was extracted using Trizol according to the manufacture's instructions.Specifically, cells were lysed in 1 ml of Trizol, kept at RT for 5 minutes, followed by addition of 200 Âµl of CHCl3, shaked vigorously for 30", spun @5000 rpm for 2 minutes. The upper phase was recovered and an equal volume of i-PrOH was added, mixed, kept for 5 minutes, and precipitated for 15 minutes @10,000 rpm using Pellet-Paint (Novagen).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Library was prepared using Truseq pair-end Illumina kit. Briefly, 10-100 ng of total RNA was reconstituted in water, mixed with Ribosomal removal Buffer containing RNAClean XP beads, and depleted from rRNA. First strand was synthesized using RT, followed by a second strand synthesis, 3' ends were adenylated and ligated to the adaptors, followed by ligateion of the 5' adaptors; the library was purified and measured on DNA-concentration
!Sample_data_processing = The resulted data were demultiplexed using Illumina CASAVA 1.8 and fastq files for each initial sample were generated
