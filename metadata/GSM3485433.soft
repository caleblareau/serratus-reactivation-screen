!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit version 2 (Illumina) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.  In brief, 1ug of total mRNA was purified using oligo-dT RNA purification beads.  Eluted RNA was fragmented and reverse transcribed, followed by a second strand synthesis, end repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation and PCR amplification.  Libraries were quantified using a universal complete KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems).  Pooled libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq or an Illumina NextSeq platform.
