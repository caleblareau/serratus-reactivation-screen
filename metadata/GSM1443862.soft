!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = 1x10^8 low passage IMR90 lung fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 15 cm dishes. After 24 h, the cells were either mock-infected or infected with e1a WT or mutant e1a expressing adenoviral vectors. 24 h post infection total RNA was isolated
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = IMR90 human primary lung embryo fibroblasts (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 u/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37Â°C in 5% CO2.

!Sample_description = mRNA sequencing
!Sample_data_processing = Libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 to obtain 50 bp-long reads. Alignment of mRNA-seq reads was performed using default parameters of Tophat to hg19 reference genome in bam format
!Sample_data_processing = Bam files were used to calculate FPKM values with the program cuffdiff (cufflinks) for all annotated refseq isoforms. Matching conditions from two independent experiments were treated as replicates in cuffdiff.
