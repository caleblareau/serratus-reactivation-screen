# serratus-reactivation-screen
CL analysis of Serrtus data for viral reactivation. 

The code here roughly 1) makes an API call for various ViralZone viruses; 2) imports them into an R environment that a) gets annotated with GEO meta data (with a bunch of small files) and b) collates hits of viral expression across various cell types and viruses. These data are used in the mansucript in Figure 1 and various supplemental tables.
